# Analyzing Jobs Postings in Data Science with SQL

[SQL for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) Capstone Project by [Markku Laine](https://markkulaine.com) (2024)


## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the data science job market in Finland by analyzing job postings published in 2023 using SQL.

**The questions I wanted answers to are:**

1. Which cities have the most data science jobs in Finland?
2. Which companies recruit the most data professionals in Finland?
3. What are the most in-demand data science job roles in Finland?
4. What are the highest-paying data science job roles in [~~Finland~~](## "Unfortunately, the dataset had only limited data points available for Finland.") the world?
5. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts and Data Engineers in Finland?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts and Data Engineers in [~~Finland~~](## "Unfortunately, the dataset had only limited data points available for Finland.") the world?


**Tools:** [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools) extension), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)


## Dataset

This project uses a modified version of the original [Job Postings in 2023](https://lukeb.co/sql_project_csvs) dataset from Luke Barousse's [SQL for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) course. The [dataset](./dataset/) consists of four CSV files, each representing a table in the *Job Postings* database (see the ER diagram below): companies (140,033 rows), job_skills (3,669,604 rows), jobs (787,686 rows), and skills (256 rows).

## Analysis

### 1. Which cities have the most data science jobs in Finland?

To identify the largest data science hubs in Finland, I filtered jobs by country and then grouped them by location.

```sql
SELECT
  job_location AS location,
  COUNT(*) AS job_count
FROM
  jobs
WHERE
  job_country = 'Finland'
GROUP BY
  job_location
ORDER BY
  job_count DESC, location
LIMIT
  10;
```
